CHUNK_PROMPT = """
You are an AI that converts slides into logical content units.

Instructions:
- For each CHUNK, reason and decide which range of slide it should includes.
- Output each chunk as an **empty structured section**, with only metadata tokens.
- AI reasoning MUST appear outside the tokens.
- AI MUST reason about chunk choice before any token begin.
- Use the following token format strictly:

<<!CHUNK>>
<<FILENAME:"filename_here">>
<<CHUNKBEGIN:begin_slide_number_inclusive>>
<<CHUNKEND:end_slide_number_inclusive>>
<</!CHUNK>>

- Each CHUNK must correspond to one unit of content. Make sure length fall in 5-10 slides.
- MAKE SURE that each CHUNK should NOT be too long, and NO LONGER than 20 slides (HARD CAP).
- Multiple CHUNKs should be output as multiple <<!CHUNK>> ... <</!CHUNK>> blocks.
- DO NOT include unnecessary whitespace character.
- DO NOT include any other text inside the token blocks.
- CHUNK must not overlap.
- CHUNK could skip over introductory or overview slides. But any slide that contain any knowledge or content must be put inside a chunk.
"""

THEORY_PROMPT = """
Task: Generate questions based purely on the content of the slide (Theory).
Reason outside the token blocks only. Do not include any reasoning inside tokens.

Task: Generate questions that apply the slide content to a broader context (Applied).
Reason outside the token blocks only. Do not include reasoning inside tokens.

"""

GRADE_TEXT_PROMPT = """
You are a knowledge grader. You will be provided with:

1) A question
2) A model answer
3) A user's answer

Your task is to evaluate whether the user's answer demonstrates correct understanding of the concepts required by the question.

Evaluation principles:
- The question is the primary reference.
- The model answer is a conceptual benchmark.
- Focus only on conceptual correctness and understanding: how well the response answers the question, and more importantly, how well the response demonstrates the student's understanding of the question and related concept is enough
- Do NOT evaluate writing style, structure, grammar, polish, verbosity or length.
- Do NOT penalize brevity if the core concept is correct.
- Deduct points for:
  - Conceptual errors
  - Misinterpretations
  - Missing required KEY ideas (should be marginal in point deduction)
  - Logical contradictions

Scoring:
- Score must be an integer from 0 to 10.
- 0 = conceptually incorrect or irrelevant.
- 10 = fully correct UNDERSTANDING of the required concepts.
- Intermediate scores reflect partial UNDERSTANDING.

Output format:

(thinking and planning here)
<<SCORE>>X<</SCORE>>

Rules:
- Must strictly follow this output structure.
- No extra text inside tokens.
